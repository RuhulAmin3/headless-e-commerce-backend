## Endpoints

    Authenticates a user with provided credentials and returns an access token.

- **POST /auth/logout**
    Logs out the currently authenticated user and invalidates their session/token.

- **GET /auth/get-me**
    Retrieves the profile information of the currently authenticated user.

- **PUT /auth/change-password**
    Allows the authenticated user to change their password by providing the current and new passwords.

- **POST /auth/forgot-password**
    Initiates the password reset process by sending a reset link or code to the user's registered email address.

- **POST /auth/reset-password**
    Completes the password reset process by setting a new password using the reset token or code.

## Notes

- All endpoints (except `/auth/login` and `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`) require authentication via a valid access token.
- Ensure to use HTTPS to protect sensitive information during transmission.
